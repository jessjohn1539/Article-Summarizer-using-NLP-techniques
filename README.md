## üìå Problem Statement

With the üìà increasing volume of digital content, readers often find it overwhelming to sift through lengthy news articles to extract valuable information. 

This project aims to address the challenge of **information overload** by developing an **Automatic Article Summarizer** that provides concise and coherent summaries of lengthy articles using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, specifically the **TextRank algorithm**.

The goal is to help users quickly grasp the key points of an article without reading it in its entirety. üöÄ

## üåü Key Features

1. **User-Friendly Input:** Users can input the URL of any news article into the web application.
2. **Article Extraction:** The app fetches the article content from the provided URL, parsing the text using libraries like **Beautiful Soup**.
3. **Text Preprocessing:** Utilizes NLP techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and sentence segmentation to prepare the text for summarization.
4. **TextRank Algorithm Implementation:** Uses the **TextRank algorithm**, a graph-based approach, to rank and extract the most important sentences from the text based on their relevance.
5. **Concise Output:** The app generates a brief yet meaningful summary, reducing the reading effort while retaining the core information.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Approach

1. **Fetch Article Content:** Use Python libraries to scrape and extract the article text from the provided URL.
2. **Preprocess Text:** Clean the extracted text by removing unnecessary elements like HTML tags, punctuation, and stopwords.
3. **Apply TextRank Algorithm:** Convert sentences into nodes of a graph, connect them based on similarity, and rank them using TextRank. The most significant sentences are extracted to form the summary.
4. **Display Summary:** Render the summarized text in the Streamlit app, allowing users to interact with and refine the output.
